## 📌 Introduction

**Smart Lender** is a machine learning–powered web application that automates the loan approval
and rejection process. Traditional loan eligibility checks are time-consuming and prone to human
bias. Smart Lender solves this by analysing an applicant's financial and personal profile in
milliseconds using a trained **Random Forest classifier**, giving an instant **Approved ✅** or
**Rejected ❌** decision.

This project was developed as part of a software engineering internship by a team of 5 members.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pushpa-sree/smart-Lender-.git
cd smart-Lender-

# 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1 – Train the Model (if not already trained)

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the training data
- Train Decision Tree, KNN, XGBoost, and Random Forest models
- Print accuracy comparison
- Save the best model to `models/loan_model.pkl`

### Step 2 – Start the Flask Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 3 – Run Automated Tests

```bash
python docs/automated_tester.py
```

This will:
- Load all 308 test records
- Run predictions and measure response times
- Generate `docs/testing_report.md` and `docs/performance_testing_report.md`

## 🔮 Future Scope

1. **Improved UI** – Rebuild the frontend as a modern React/Next.js web application with animations and better UX
2. **Confidence Score** – Display the model's probability score alongside the binary decision
3. **Explainability** – Integrate SHAP or LIME to explain why a loan was approved/rejected
4. **Database Integration** – Store application history in SQLite / PostgreSQL
5. **API-First Design** – Expose a RESTful API so mobile apps can consume predictions
6. **Admin Dashboard** – Analytics panel showing approval trends, demographics, and model performance over time
7. **Production Deployment** – Deploy on AWS/GCP/Heroku with Gunicorn + Nginx
8. **Bias & Fairness Audit** – Analyse model predictions across gender and demographic groups
